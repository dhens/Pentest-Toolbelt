# Pentest-Toolbelt

As I learn web application security, I will post the tools I create along the way here.

## /Reverse-Access
* backon.py - socket client to recieve commands from backonserv.py
* backonserv.py - socket server that allows sending commands to be run in backon.py's computer's cmd prompt

## Fuzzing

#### PostRouteBruteforce.py:
  * Enter the post route of a domain
  * Enter the desired username
  * Will bruteforce the target domain route and use rockyou.txt to brute force
  **Workers and timeout can be modified to suit your needs**
